# Q_Learning_Reinforcement_Learning
ou have to choose two environments from https://gym.openai.com/ (Links to an external site.) and solve those tasks with RL algorithms. You have to write a 5 page (strict) long report about the problem, and your work. For guidelines check out "Stanford standard": http://cs229.stanford.edu/final-report-guidelines.pdf (Links to an external site.) and reports: http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects.html#report (Links to an external site.) . Coding is not necessary; you can use already written solutions.
